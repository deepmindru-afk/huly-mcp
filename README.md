**Huly MCP** is a feature-complete MCP server for [Huly](https://huly.io/) integration. Published on npm as [`@firfi/huly-mcp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@firfi/huly-mcp).

## Installation

The standard configuration works with most MCP clients:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "huly": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@firfi/huly-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "HULY_URL": "https://huly.app",
        "HULY_EMAIL": "your@email.com",
        "HULY_PASSWORD": "yourpassword",
        "HULY_WORKSPACE": "yourworkspace"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<details>
<summary>Codex</summary>

Use Codex's MCP manager:

```bash
codex mcp add huly \
  --env HULY_URL=https://huly.app \
  --env HULY_EMAIL=your@email.com \
  --env HULY_PASSWORD=yourpassword \
  --env HULY_WORKSPACE=yourworkspace \
  -- npx -y @firfi/huly-mcp@latest
```

Or add it directly to `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.huly]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@firfi/huly-mcp@latest"]

[mcp_servers.huly.env]
HULY_URL = "https://huly.app"

        "HULY_WORKSPACE": "yourworkspace"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

## Updating

The `@latest` tag asks the package runner for the newest version. Some MCP clients keep server processes or resolved installs alive, so restart or re-add the server when updating:

| Client | How to update |
|--------|--------------|
| **Codex** | `codex mcp remove huly` then re-add with the install command above. If your password has shell-sensitive characters, edit `~/.codex/config.toml` directly instead |
| **Claude Code** | `claude mcp remove huly` then re-add with the install command above |
| **Claude Desktop** | Restart the app (it runs `npx` on startup) |
| **VS Code / Cursor** | Restart the MCP server from the command palette/configured client or reload the window |
| **OpenCode** | Restart OpenCode or start a new session after config changes |
| **npx (manual)** | `npx -y @firfi/huly-mcp@latest` — the `-y` flag auto-confirms install prompts |

## HTTP Transport

By default, the server uses stdio transport. For HTTP transport (Streamable HTTP):

```bash
HULY_URL=https://huly.app \
HULY_EMAIL=your@email.com \
HULY_PASSWORD=yourpassword \
HULY_WORKSPACE=yourworkspace \
MCP_TRANSPORT=http \
npx -y @firfi/huly-mcp@latest
```

Server listens on `http://127.0.0.1:3000/mcp` by default.

Configure with `MCP_HTTP_PORT` and `MCP_HTTP_HOST`:

```bash
MCP_TRANSPORT=http MCP_HTTP_PORT=8080 MCP_HTTP_HOST=0.0.0.0 npx -y @firfi/huly-mcp@latest
```

### HTTP MCP Protocol Support

The HTTP server supports both the existing SDK initialize-compatible Streamable HTTP flow and the 2026 stateless HTTP flow at the same `/mcp` endpoint. Dispatch is per request:

- Requests with `MCP-Protocol-Version: 2026-07-28`, matching `_meta.io.modelcontextprotocol/protocolVersion`, or `server/discover` use the 2026 stateless dispatcher.
- Requests without 2026 protocol signals continue through the SDK transport for compatibility with existing clients.

The 2026 path requires one JSON-RPC message per POST, `Accept: application/json, text/event-stream`, `Mcp-Method`, method-specific `Mcp-Name`, and per-request `_meta.io.modelcontextprotocol/*` client metadata. Huly credentials are still configured separately through env vars or supported `x-huly-*` headers.

For hosted or tunneled HTTP deployments, you can require an MCP endpoint bearer token:

```bash
MCP_TRANSPORT=http \
MCP_AUTH_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" \
npx -y @firfi/huly-mcp@latest
```

HTTP clients must then send:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <MCP_AUTH_TOKEN>
```

`MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` protects only the MCP HTTP `/mcp` endpoint. It is unrelated to `HULY_TOKEN`, does not authenticate to Huly, and does not replace `HULY_EMAIL` / `HULY_PASSWORD` / `HULY_TOKEN`. Huly credentials are still required through process env vars or, for hosted URL deployments, the supported `x-huly-*` headers. Stdio deployments do not use `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`.

### Hosted HTTP Header Configuration

For hosted URL deployments, keep the server process configured with `MCP_TRANSPORT=http`. A hosting layer can forward per-session Huly credentials as request headers, so one hosted server can serve different Huly workspaces without process-wide `HULY_*` env vars.

Supported v1 headers:

| Header | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `x-huly-url` | Yes | Huly instance URL |
| `x-huly-workspace` | Yes | Workspace identifier |
| `x-huly-token` | Yes | Huly API token |
| `x-huly-connection-timeout` | No | Connection timeout in ms |

If any `x-huly-*` header is present, all required headers must be present. Missing values are not filled from environment variables. Email/password auth is not supported in hosted header configuration v1.

For a Smithery publish schema example, see [docs/SMITHERY_URL_PUBLISH.md](docs/SMITHERY_URL_PUBLISH.md).

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `HULY_URL` | Yes | Huly instance URL |
| `HULY_EMAIL` | Auth* | Account email |
| `HULY_PASSWORD` | Auth* | Account password |
| `HULY_TOKEN` | Auth* | API token (alternative to email/password) |
| `HULY_WORKSPACE` | Yes | Workspace identifier |
| `HULY_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT` | No | Connection timeout in ms. Omit to use the package default. |
| `MCP_TRANSPORT` | No | Transport type: `stdio` (default) or `http` |
| `MCP_HTTP_PORT` | No | HTTP server port (falls back to `PORT`, then 3000) |
| `MCP_HTTP_HOST` | No | HTTP server host. Omit to bind to the package default loopback host. |
| `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` | No | Optional bearer token required by HTTP clients for `/mcp`. This protects the MCP endpoint only; it is not a Huly API token. |
| `TOOLSETS` | No | Comma-separated tool categories to expose. If neither `TOOLSETS` nor `TOOLS` is set, all native Huly tools are exposed. Example: `issues,projects,search` |
| `TOOLS` | No | Comma-separated exact tool names to expose in addition to selected toolsets. Example: `list_documents,create_issue` |

*Auth: Provide either `HULY_EMAIL` + `HULY_PASSWORD` or `HULY_TOKEN`.

## Built-in Diagnostic Tools

`get_version` returns the current server version and latest npm version.

`get_huly_context` returns sanitized runtime/configuration context for the current MCP session without connecting to Huly. It reports package version, transport, auth mode, sanitized Huly URL origin/host/protocol, workspace, timeout, config sources, and native tool scope filtering. Tokens, passwords, email values, credential headers, URL paths, URL query strings, and URL credentials are never returned.

## MCP Resources

The server exposes read-only MCP Resources as JSON context for clients that support `resources/read`.

<!-- resources:start -->
<!-- AUTO-GENERATED from src/mcp/resources.ts resourceTemplates. Do not edit manually. Run `pnpm update-readme` to regenerate. -->
| Template | Name | Description | MIME Type |
|----------|------|-------------|-----------|
| `huly://projects/{project}` | `huly-project` | Read full details for a Huly tracker project by project identifier, for example huly://projects/HULY. | `application/json` |
| `huly://issues/{issue}` | `huly-issue` | Read full details for a Huly issue by full issue identifier, for example huly://issues/HULY-123. | `application/json` |
| `huly://projects/{project}/issues/{issue}` | `huly-project-issue` | Read full details for a Huly issue by project identifier and issue number, for example huly://projects/HULY/issues/123. | `application/json` |
<!-- resources:end -->

`resources/list` returns concrete active project resources. Issue resources are template-based: use `resources/templates/list` to discover supported issue URI templates, then read a known issue URI.

## Roadmap

The roadmap is driven by SDK parity and the project principle that this server should expose LLM-first tools: clear names, self-contained parameters, automatic identifier resolution, and single-call correctness. The audited source of truth lives in [plans/huly-sdk-gap-matrix.md](plans/huly-sdk-gap-matrix.md), with machine-checkable classifications in [plans/sdk-parity-ledger.json](plans/sdk-parity-ledger.json).

Highest-value additions for coding agents:

- Generic space follow-ups: role/permission definition writes, generic space creation, and module-specific wrappers above the shared space foundation. Generic space metadata, member/owner mutations, and typed-space role member mutations are covered by the shared spaces tools.
- Core schema/admin follow-ups: guarded attribute/enum writes, role/permission definition writes, generic space creation, global space admins, and module-specific wrappers above the shared space foundation.
- Drive follow-ups: drive create/update/delete, item move/rename/delete, adding new versions to existing files, permissions, and comments/activity.
- Team planner/reporting: team agendas, workload/capacity summaries, visibility-aware free/busy views, document action items, and planner automation diagnostics.
- Recruiting: vacancies, candidates, applications, application statuses, recruiter assignment, reviews, opinions, skills, and related comments/attachments/activity.
- Controlled documents and trainings: controlled document spaces/projects, review/approval workflows, templates, categories, snapshots/history, training assignments, attempts, scoring, and results.
- Module-specific tag wrappers for tag-backed concepts such as recruiting skills, controlled-document labels, and contact tags. Board-label definitions and board-card label attachment are covered by the `boards` tools.

Planned feature surfaces:

- Implemented foundation: generic space discovery and safe existing-space administration are covered by `spaces` tools for listing/getting spaces, listing/getting space types, reading permissions, updating common metadata, adding/removing members, and replacing owners.
- Controlled Documents / TraceX documents: controlled spaces/projects, controlled document CRUD, quality/technical docs, co-authors/reviewers/approvers, e-signature workflows, release/effective-date metadata, change control, training linkage, controlled-document comments, and snapshots/history.
- Products and product versions: product spaces, members, descriptions, attachments, versions, version state transitions, and change-control links.
- Trainings, questions, and assessments: training revisions, releases, requests, due dates, max attempts, question banks, answer options, correct-answer data, submissions, scoring, and reporting.
- Drive: first slice covers listing/getting drives, path traversal/list/get items, idempotent folder creation, uploads with parent creation, version listing, and restoring existing versions. Remaining gaps are drive create/update/delete, item move/rename/delete, adding new versions to existing files, comments/activity, and permissions/members.
- HR: departments, nested departments, staff mixins, managers, subscribers, team leads, request types, PTO/sick/overtime/remote requests, public holidays, and schedule/table reports.
- Recruiting: vacancies, talents/candidates, applications, matches, reviews, verdicts/opinions, vacancy-company lists, skills, and recruiting-specific custom fields/relations.
- Surveys and polls: survey CRUD, poll creation/attachment, survey question data, completion status, and results.
- Generic approval requests: create/list/approve/reject/cancel approval requests, decision comments, required approval counts, request status, and requested/approved/rejected people.
- Boards: board CRUD, board cards, status workflows, members/assignees, location, cover/archive fields, board labels, menu/archive views, saved views, viewlets, and common board preference reads.
- Inventory: category hierarchy CRUD, product CRUD, variant/SKU CRUD, and product-scoped photo, attachment, comment, and activity wrappers are covered by first-class tools; category/variant discussion wrappers remain outside this slice.
- Leads write surface: create/update/delete funnels and leads, status changes, assignment, start dates, customer descriptions, person customer support, and lead comments/attachments/labels/relations.
- Contacts: person channels, social identities, provider discovery, contact statuses, notes/comments, person attachments, person merge, employee invite/create/kick/reinvite, and inactive employee management.
- Calendar: calendar CRUD/config, external calendar sync metadata, primary calendar management, schedule objects, participant mutations, and RSVP/status support when stable.
- Team planner and schedule reporting: team agendas, workload/capacity summaries, and visibility-aware free/busy views across members/projects.
- Virtual office and meetings: offices, floors, rooms, access/language/default recording/transcription settings, meeting schedules, active participants, room info, meeting notes/transcript records (minutes), recordings, and device preferences.
- Chat and communication: request-access flows if Huly exposes a stable model, pinned messages, translation, applets, in-message polls, guest communication settings, and external Gmail/Telegram/Huly Mail surfaces plus provider-specific attachments once compatible packages/APIs are proven.
- Notifications and activity: browser/push subscription internals, provider defaults, UI presenter/viewlet metadata, and activity control/extension metadata.
- Attachments and media: previews/preview metadata and friendly wrappers for additional object types beyond issue/document/inventory product.
- Core schema and workspace administration: attribute/property create/update/delete/hide, enum CRUD/options, sequence management, role/permission definition writes, generic space creation, global space admins, integrations registry, invite settings, role capability settings, and workspace setting metadata.
- Integrations: GitHub repository/project mappings and sync metadata (deferred), Google Calendar connect/configure/sync controls, Bitrix entity/field mappings and sync status, Gmail/email channel messages, Telegram messages, Huly Mail/Mail plugin behavior, AI assistant integration state, and AI bot configuration if server-side APIs expose stable behavior.
- Templates, rating, support, billing, analytics, views, workbench, and preferences: read-only message template/category/field discovery is covered; message template writes/rendering remain deferred until provider semantics are proven. Generic saved filtered view discovery, filtered-view detail reads, viewlet metadata, and viewlet preference config discovery are covered by `views` tools; board-specific saved views, viewlets, and common board preference reads remain covered by `boards` tools. Document/person rating data is blocked by unpublished `@hcengineering/rating` SDK package (#90); support conversations, billing tier/status discovery, onboarding channels, tabs/widgets/apps, broader workbench state, and non-view module preference discovery/update remain future surfaces.
- Document-specific gaps: snapshot restore, backlinks, notes, structured action items/tables, PDF/export, advanced document relationships, and document printing/export once SDK support is safe.

MCP resource roadmap:

- Return resource links from list/search tool results for direct `resources/read` follow-up.
- Add document resources when document reads have a stable URI shape and context-friendly payload.
- Consider scoped/paginated issue listing only when filters prevent very large `resources/list` responses.
- Consider resource `subscribe` and `listChanged` support after stateful sessions and a Huly change source are available.

SDK upgrade revisit:

- Revisit `@hcengineering/*` upgrades when a newer release is available after `0.7.423`.
- Verify published tarballs, not only npm metadata, before accepting SDK upgrades.
- Require valid published declaration files for direct Huly dependencies.
- Upgrade direct Huly package declarations coherently in `package.json`; do not accept lockfile-only transitive rewrites.
- Run `pnpm check-all` and local Huly integration tests before treating an SDK upgrade as viable.

### Projects

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `list_project_target_preferences` | List low-level per-project tracker target preference records. These Huly ProjectTargetPreference records are attached to projects and used by tracker UI/workflows to remember target-related preference props. Omit project to list recent preferences across projects, or pass a project identifier to inspect one project's preference. Props are SDK-open key/value payloads. |
| `upsert_project_target_preference` | Create or update the low-level ProjectTargetPreference record for a project. This refreshes usedOn and merges SDK-open target preference props by key. Use for tracker SDK parity or advanced administration; ordinary project and issue workflows usually do not need this tool. |
| `list_projects` | List all Huly projects. Returns projects sorted by name. Supports filtering by archived status. |
| `get_project` | Get full details of a Huly project including its statuses. Returns project name, description, archived flag, default status, and all available statuses. |
| `list_statuses` | List all issue statuses for a Huly project with workflow category and default info. Returns status name, category, and isDefault. Use this to discover valid statuses before creating or updating issues. |
| `create_project` | Create a new Huly tracker project. Idempotent: returns existing project if one with the same identifier already exists (created=false). Identifier must be 1-5 uppercase alphanumeric chars starting with a letter. |
| `update_project` | Update a Huly project. Only provided fields are modified. Set description to null to clear it. |
| `delete_project` | Permanently delete a Huly project. All issues, milestones, and components in this project will be orphaned. This action cannot be undone. |

### Issues

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|

| `set_issue_component` | Set or clear the component on a Huly issue. Pass null for component to clear it. |
| `delete_component` | Permanently delete a Huly component. This action cannot be undone. |
| `list_issues` | Query Huly issues with optional filters. Returns issues sorted by modification date (newest first). Supports filtering by project, exact workflow status name (status), Huly SDK task.statusCategory key (statusCategory: UnStarted, ToDo, Active, Won, Lost), assignee, component, and parentIssue (to list children of a specific issue). Supports searching by title substring (titleSearch) and description content (descriptionSearch). |
| `get_issue` | Retrieve full details for a Huly issue including markdown description. Use this to view issue content, comments, or full metadata. |
| `create_issue` | Create a new issue in a Huly project. Optionally set taskType by ID or display name; it is resolved within the target project's project type, and status is validated against that task type's workflow. Use list_task_types or get_project_type to discover valid task types and statuses. Optionally create as a sub-issue by specifying parentIssue. Description supports markdown formatting. Returns the created issue identifier. |
| `update_issue` | Update fields on an existing Huly issue. Optionally set taskType by ID or display name; it is resolved within the target project's project type, and the status is preserved only when valid for the new task type. Use list_task_types or get_project_type to discover valid task types and statuses. Only provided fields are modified. Description updates support markdown. |
| `add_issue_label` | Add a tag/label to a Huly issue. Creates the tag if it doesn't exist in the project. |
| `remove_issue_label` | Remove a tag/label from a Huly issue. Detaches the label reference; does not delete the label definition. |
| `delete_issue` | Permanently delete a Huly issue. This action cannot be undone. |
| `move_issue` | Move an issue to a new parent (making it a sub-issue) or to top-level (null). Updates parent/child relationships and sub-issue counts. |
| `list_issue_templates` | List issue templates in a Huly project. Templates define reusable issue configurations. Returns templates sorted by modification date (newest first). |
| `get_issue_template` | Retrieve full details for a Huly issue template including children (sub-task templates). Use this to view template content, default values, and child template IDs. |
| `create_issue_template` | Create a new issue template in a Huly project. Templates define default values for new issues. Optionally include children (sub-task templates) that will become sub-issues when creating issues from this template. Returns the created template ID and title. |
| `create_issue_from_template` | Create a new issue from a template. Applies template defaults, allowing overrides for specific fields. If the template has children (sub-task templates), sub-issues are created automatically unless includeChildren is set to false. Returns the created issue identifier and count of children created. |
| `update_issue_template` | Update fields on an existing Huly issue template. Only provided fields are modified. |
| `delete_issue_template` | Permanently delete a Huly issue template. This action cannot be undone. |
| `add_template_child` | Add a child (sub-task) template to an issue template. The child defines default values for sub-issues created when using create_issue_from_template. Returns the child template ID. |
| `remove_template_child` | Remove a child (sub-task) template from an issue template by its child ID. Get child IDs from get_issue_template response. |
| `add_issue_relation` | Add a relation between two issues. Relation types: 'blocks' (source blocks target — pushes into target's blockedBy), 'is-blocked-by' (source is blocked by target — pushes into source's blockedBy), 'relates-to' (bidirectional link — updates both sides). targetIssue accepts cross-project identifiers like 'OTHER-42'. No-op if the relation already exists. |
| `remove_issue_relation` | Remove a relation between two issues. Mirrors add_issue_relation: 'blocks' pulls from target's blockedBy, 'is-blocked-by' pulls from source's blockedBy, 'relates-to' pulls from both sides. No-op if the relation doesn't exist. |
| `list_issue_relations` | List all relations of an issue. Returns blockedBy (issues blocking this one), blocks (issues this one blocks), relations (bidirectional issue links), and documents (linked documents with title/teamspace). |
| `link_document_to_issue` | Link a Huly document to an issue. The link appears in the issue's Relations panel in the UI. Idempotent: no-op if the document is already linked. Use list_issue_relations to see linked documents. |
| `unlink_document_from_issue` | Remove a document link from an issue. Idempotent: no-op if the document is not linked. |
| `list_related_issue_targets` | List rules that choose the default destination project for related issues. A spaceRule says related issues from one space default to targetProject. A classRule says related issues for one object class default to targetProject. targetProject is a project identifier, or null for no default destination project. |
| `set_related_issue_target` | Set the default destination project for related issues from a space or object class. For space, creates or updates a spaceRule. For objectClass, only updates an existing classRule; this tool never creates classRule targets. Pass targetProject as a project identifier, or null to clear the default destination project. |
| `delete_related_issue_space_target` | Delete the spaceRule that chooses the default destination project for related issues from one space. This only deletes spaceRule targets; classRule deletion is intentionally unsupported because class rules may be model-provided. |

### Comments

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `list_comments` | List comments on a Huly issue. Returns comments sorted by creation date (oldest first). |
| `add_comment` | Add a comment to a Huly issue. Comment body supports markdown formatting. |
| `update_comment` | Update an existing comment on a Huly issue. Comment body supports markdown formatting. |
| `delete_comment` | Delete a comment from a Huly issue. This action cannot be undone. |

### Milestones

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|

| `set_issue_milestone` | Set or clear the milestone on a Huly issue. Pass null for milestone to clear it. |
| `delete_milestone` | Permanently delete a Huly milestone. This action cannot be undone. |

### Documents

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `list_document_snapshots` | List version-history snapshots for one Huly document. A snapshot is a saved point-in-time copy from the document's change history. Resolve the document by teamspace plus document title or ID. Returns snapshotId, documentId, teamspaceId, title, parentDocumentId, and timestamps; markdown content is intentionally omitted. Use get_document_snapshot with snapshotId when reading content. |
| `get_document_snapshot` | Get one point-in-time Huly document history snapshot and return markdown content. Resolve the document by teamspace plus document title or ID; resolve the snapshot by snapshotId, exact snapshot title, or exact createdOn timestamp. Prefer snapshotId from list_document_snapshots when titles or dates may collide. Restore is out of scope. |
| `list_teamspaces` | List all Huly document teamspaces. Returns teamspaces sorted by name. Supports filtering by archived status. |

Body editing has two mutually exclusive modes: (1) content replaces the entire markdown body, (2) old_text + new_text performs exact targeted search-and-replace. Use markdown links to current-workspace Huly browse URLs for native references; Huly browse links returned in get_document content round-trip as native references. The URL identifies the object; link text is display text; plain issue keys stay text. External URLs stay normal markdown links. For targeted replace, multiple matches error unless replace_all is true; empty new_text deletes matched text. Content supports native Mermaid diagrams. Returns a 'url' field pointing to the document in the Huly web app. |

## Troubleshooting

### Passwords with special characters

If your Huly password contains characters like `*`, `%`, `!`, or `#`, passing it via CLI environment flags such as `-e` or `--env` may fail because the shell interprets these characters before they reach the process.

**Solution**: Edit your MCP config file directly instead of passing the password through the shell:

- Codex: `~/.codex/config.toml`
- Claude Code: `~/.claude.json` (user scope) or `.mcp.json` (project scope)
- Claude Desktop: `claude_desktop_config.json` in the location listed in the installation section
- VS Code and Cursor: use the client config location from the installation section; avoid committing workspace files that contain real credentials
- Windsurf: edit your Windsurf MCP configuration file directly
- OpenCode: `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`

For Claude JSON config, the shell-sensitive characters above can be written directly. JSON-reserved characters such as `"` and `\` still need normal JSON escaping:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "huly": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@firfi/huly-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "HULY_URL": "https://your-huly-instance.com",
        "HULY_EMAIL": "you@example.com",
        "HULY_PASSWORD": "p@ss*w0rd!#%",
        "HULY_WORKSPACE": "your-workspace"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively, use `HULY_TOKEN` instead of email/password to bypass password auth entirely (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)).

### MCP client shows "Failed to reconnect"

After changing MCP configuration, some clients (including Claude Code) require a full restart — not just a reconnect. Exit the application completely and reopen it.

You can verify the connection works independently with:
```bash
claude mcp list  # Should show "Connected"
```

### Self-hosted Huly: account locked after failed login attempts

Huly locks password login after 5 failed API authentication attempts. This commonly happens during initial setup when the password is misconfigured. The lock persists in the database across service restarts.

**Symptoms**: `PasswordLoginLocked` error from the MCP server, and the Huly web UI shows "Password login is locked due to too many failed attempts. Please use an OTP login method to unlock your account." (OTP won't work without SMTP configured.)

**Fix** — reset the lock counter in CockroachDB:

```bash
# Find your account UUID and check lock status
docker exec -e PGPASSWORD=<your_cockroach_password> <cockroach_container> \
  cockroach sql --host=localhost --user=<db_user> --database=defaultdb --insecure \
  -e "SELECT uuid, failed_login_attempts FROM global_account.account;"

# Reset the counter
docker exec -e PGPASSWORD=<your_cockroach_password> <cockroach_container> \
  cockroach sql --host=localhost --user=<db_user> --database=defaultdb --insecure \
  -e "UPDATE global_account.account SET failed_login_attempts = 0 WHERE uuid = '<your_account_uuid>';"
```

The CockroachDB credentials can be found in your Huly `compose.yml` or via `docker exec <cockroach_container> env | grep COCKROACH`.

### Windows-specific notes

- **Bash wrapper scripts** (sourcing `.env` files) may not work reliably when launched by MCP clients on Windows. Prefer setting env vars directly in the MCP config JSON.
- **Docker pulls over SSH** may fail on Windows due to credential manager issues. Pull images from the server desktop if needed.
