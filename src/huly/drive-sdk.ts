/**
 * Temporary minimal Drive SDK boundary.
 *
 * `@hcengineering/drive@0.7.423` is present in the resolved Huly dependency
 * graph, but its published tarball has no `.d.ts` declarations and pulls a
 * newer mixed SDK graph when imported directly. Keep this file small,
 * searchable, and limited to constants/types needed by MCP Drive tools.
 *
 * Remove this boundary after issue #90 is resolved and a compatible typed
 * Drive package can be imported normally.
